# CISC-499-XAI-For-Waste-Management-Using-EA
This repository contains the files associated with our CISC499 capstone project, including our model, the datasets we obtained our information from, and any scientific articles we used as references.

Our capstone project aims to use Explainable AI (XAI) to provide insights and reasoning into the optimal route for waste collection in Brooklyn, US. The motivation behind this project is due to the vast amount of waste generated in large cities that go unmanaged. This waste goes unmanaged due to un-optimized collection routes and frequencies. By modelling Brooklyn's waste collection using an evolutionary algorithm (EA), we can obtain the route that minimizes the distance covered and maximizes fuel efficiency.

Using XAI to provide reasoning for our results will help policy-makers understand the logic behind the model we used, which increases the potential for our optimized route to be implemented.
